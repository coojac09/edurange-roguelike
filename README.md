New Roguelike scenario for EDURange


Randomized tasks upon every attempt

NAT must have an on-login script which randomizes other instances


IDEAS:


Directories represent rooms
Instances represent floors

5 floors, harder and more random as they go

Inventory simulated via unlocking new commands
Shared bin folder using Docker to manage command inventory

Monsters via processes that need to be 'killed' at random intervals
