The password to unlock the lockbox is one of the words in taffy.txt

To find the word, use grep to determine the following:

1. Number of lines containing "ff"
2. Number of lines containing "-"
3. Number of lines containing "'" (an apostraphe)

Then, multiply together the numbers you found for parts 1 and 2
Then, subtract the number you found for part 3

This resulting number is the word number of the password
(Hyphenated words are counted as one, punctuation is otherwise ignored)

Once you have found the word, type "unzip lockbox.zip" and you will be prompted to enter it. 
If you found the correct word, you will be rewarded with the scroll containing the information for the next level. 

Hint: Find the option for grep which counts lines, keep in mind some characters need to be escaped "\" when searching for them.
Necessary Commands: ls, cat, grep, unzip, man
