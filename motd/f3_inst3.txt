The password to unlock the lockbox is one of the words in lighthouse.txt

To find the word, use grep to find the following:

First, find the number of lines in lighthouse.txt which do NOT contain "ea"
Then, subtract the number of lines which DO contain "I"
This is the word number of the password. 

Once you have found the password, type "unzip lockbox.zip" and you will be prompted to enter it.
If you are correct, you will be rewarded with the scroll containing the information to get to the next level.

Hint: Find the grep option for counting lines, and the grep option for inverse line matching.
Necessary Commands: ls, cat, grep, unzip, man
